# About Me

#### **|| ROS || Machine Learning ||**
#### **|| Embedded Software || Electronics ||**

I am pursuing a career in the Autonomous Vehicle or Robotics field. I am a 3 year student-athlete at Oakland university with one and a half years of professional engineering experience at automotive companies. Learning about the Robot Operating System (ROS) and applying it to robots is fascinating. In my free time I like to learn about machine learning, work on engineering projects, and play hockey.
